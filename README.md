# todo-app
Basic Developer Version of my Todo App. Not the prettiest but maintains a coherent theme. Coded using react native and javascript. Showcases my ability to code both Front End and Back End. Technicals used include AsynchStorage, Arrays, Nested Arrays, Objects, libraires, and UseState.

I've included a zip file for convience. It includes everything in this repo except the readme file and the zip itself (obsv).
